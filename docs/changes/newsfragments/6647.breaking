QCoDeS no longer attempts to automatically disable Sypders User module reloader (UMR).
The code was no longer working correctly with the latest version of Spyder and is not
maintainable since Spyder does not have a public api to disable UMR. If you use
QCoDeS from an editable install it is strongly recommended to disable UMR for QCoDeS.
See :ref:`gettingstarted` for more details.
